            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>I am <strong>Sharayu Borude</strong>, and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering while building strong skills in web development. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and databases, and 
               I enjoy creating clean, user-friendly, and efficient applications. Along with my growing tech stack, 
               I bring problem-solving ability, communication skills, and a motivated learning mindset that helps me continuously improve and contribute effectively to modern development projects.</p>

            <p>I am a dedicated professional with over three years of experience as a Quality Senior Technician at Tata Electronics Pvt. Ltd., where I prepared ISO-compliant inspection reports, performed data analysis using PIWEB and Tableau, and operated advanced measurement systems like OGP, CMM, EQUATOR, MICRO VU, ALT, and ISRA for high-precision quality control. 
               I have trained junior technicians in key quality methodologies including 7QC, Six Sigma, GD&T, PDCA, WHY-WHY, FACA, and Kaizen, while also conducting daily meetings, preparing NCMR presentations, and managing MSOP documentation. 
               My achievements, including winning the Techinovation Competition and receiving the Invictus Award, demonstrate my commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.</p>
          
            <p>Outside of studying and coding, I enjoy creativity, exploring new ideas, and continuously improving myself. I’m always excited to learn, build, and grow — and 
               I look forward to making my mark in the world of full stack development.</p>
